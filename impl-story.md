# Implementation Agile Workflow

This notepad guides the implementation of stories in the agile workflow.

## Current Story Context

- Epic: Epic-1: Core Assessment Framework Development for Allied Health Practices
- Story: Story-1: Design Comprehensive Business Assessment Questionnaire Structure with Weighted Scoring System for Allied Health Practices (Initial Focus: Physiotherapy)
- Status: In Progress

## Implementation Workflow

### 1. Initial Setup

- [ ] Review the current story details and requirements
- [ ] Identify any dependencies or prerequisites
- [ ] Break down implementation into tasks

### 2. Development Process

- [ ] Write tests for the first task (Test-Driven Development)
- [ ] Implement the functionality to pass the tests
- [ ] Document your implementation decisions
- [ ] Update story task status to "Complete"
- [ ] Move to the next task

### 3. Completion Checklist

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Code is clean and follows project standards
- [ ] All tasks are marked as complete
- [ ] Story status is updated to "Complete"

## Documentation Updates

As you implement the story, keep track of:
- Key decisions made
- Issues encountered and how they were resolved
- Changes to architecture or design
- Commands or procedures worth noting for future reference

## TDD Process

1. Write a failing test that defines the expected behavior
2. Implement the minimum code to make the test pass
3. Refactor code while ensuring tests continue to pass
4. Document the implementation

## Progress Tracking

Update the story file (.ai/epic-1/story-1.story.md) with:
- Task status updates
- Implementation notes
- Testing results
- Any blockers encountered

## Current Focus
Starting with Research and Analysis tasks:
- Researching physiotherapy practice challenges
- Analyzing existing assessment frameworks
- Identifying key performance indicators
- Understanding industry benchmarks
