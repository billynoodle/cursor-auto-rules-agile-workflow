/**
 * Financial Health Module - Expense Management Questions
 * 
 * These questions probe deeply into expense control practices with
 * intentionally challenging inquiries designed to reveal weaknesses in
 * cost management, overhead control, and budget planning.
 * 
 * NOTE: As per the Tooltip Readability Review Initiative (2024-08-05),
 * all helpText in this file should be reviewed for:
 * - Plain language accessibility
 * - Elimination of unnecessary jargon
 * - Clarity of examples and explanations
 * - Appropriate context (benchmarks, metrics)
 * - Consistent tone and difficulty level
 * 
 * The overhead ratio question (fin-exp-001) has been updated with an enhanced
 * tooltip that can serve as a model for other questions in this module.

To calculate it: Add up all expenses (rent, staff wages, utilities, supplies, etc.) but don\'t include what you pay to practitioners. Then divide by your total income and multiply by 100. For example, if your practice makes $300,000 per year and spends $150,000 on expenses (not counting payments to practitioners), your overhead ratio is 50%. The lower this number, the more money available for practitioners and profit. Most successful practices keep this under 45%, while practices struggling with profitability often have overhead over 65%. Even a 5% reduction in overhead could mean thousands of dollars more available for practitioner pay or practice investment.',
