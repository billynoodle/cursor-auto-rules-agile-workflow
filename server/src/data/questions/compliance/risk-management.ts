/**
 * Compliance Module - Risk Management Questions
 * 
 * These questions probe deeply into compliance risks and management with
 * intentionally challenging inquiries designed to reveal vulnerabilities and
 * expose potentially costly compliance gaps.
 * 
 * NOTE: As per the Tooltip Readability Review Initiative (2024-08-05),
 * all helpText in this file should be reviewed for:
 * - Plain language accessibility
 * - Elimination of unnecessary jargon
 * - Clarity of examples and explanations
 * - Appropriate context (benchmarks, metrics)
 * - Consistent tone and difficulty level
 * 
 * The compliance risk assessment question (comp-risk-001) has been updated with an enhanced
 * tooltip that can serve as a model for other questions in this module.

These assessments look for gaps in how you protect patient information, bill insurance correctly, maintain proper documentation, and follow healthcare laws. Rules change frequently, and penalties for breaking them can be severeâ€”often $10,000+ per violation. Having an independent expert do this assessment is best because they bring fresh eyes and specialized knowledge. For example, they might spot that your patient consent forms are outdated, your staff needs HIPAA refresher training, or your documentation doesn\'t support the billing codes you\'re using. Without regular assessments, many practices unknowingly develop bad habits that can lead to insurance audits, refund demands, fines, or even exclusion from insurance programs.',
