- Monitor offline/online sync test reliability
- Consider adding more edge case scenarios

## March 25, 2024 - AssessmentPage Component Test Failures

### Current Failures
1. **Multiple Elements Selection Issue**
   - Test: Navigation element checks in AssessmentPage
   - Error: Multiple elements found with "Financial Health Assessment" text
   - Root Cause: Ambiguous selector matching both navigation button and module title
   - Fix: Use more specific selector with test ID `module-button-mod-financial-001`

2. **Module Content Persistence**
   - Test: Locked module navigation test
   - Error: Financial module content not showing after attempting locked module access
   - Root Cause: `handleModuleSelect` function not maintaining current module state
   - Fix: Preserve current module when attempting to access locked modules

3. **Progress Calculation**
   - Test: Progress update after answering questions
   - Error: Expected 50% progress, showing 100%
   - Root Cause: Incorrect progress calculation in `calculateModuleProgress`
   - Fix: Ensure proper calculation based on answered questions count

4. **localStorage Integration**
   - Test: Answer saving functionality
   - Error: localStorage.setItem not being called
   - Root Cause: Answer change handler not properly integrated
   - Fix: Ensure proper triggering of `handleAnswerChange` function

### Impact Analysis
- These failures affect core assessment functionality:
  - Module navigation
  - Progress tracking
  - Answer persistence
  - User experience with locked modules

### Resolution Plan
1. Update test selectors to be more specific and resilient
2. Fix module selection logic to properly handle locked modules
3. Correct progress calculation algorithm
4. Ensure proper integration of localStorage for answer persistence
