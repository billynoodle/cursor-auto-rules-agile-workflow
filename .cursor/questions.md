## **Compliance Module**

### **Risk Management Questions**

* **Question ID**: comp-risk-001  
   **Text**: When was your last comprehensive compliance risk assessment conducted, and by whom?  
   **Type**: Multiple Choice  
   **Options**:  
  * Within past year by qualified external party (5)  
  * Within past year internally (3)  
  * 1-3 years ago by external party (2)  
  * 1-3 years ago internally (1)  
  * Never conducted or \>3 years ago (0)  
     **Tooltip**: A compliance risk assessment is a check-up of your practice's ability to follow healthcare rules. It looks for gaps in patient privacy, billing, and documentation. Rules change often, and penalties for violations can exceed $10,000 per incident. An external expert can spot issues like outdated consent forms or inadequate staff training that could lead to audits or fines.  
* **Question ID**: comp-risk-002  
   **Text**: Do you have a formal breach response plan with specific procedures, roles, and regulatory notification processes?  
   **Type**: Multiple Choice  
   **Options**:  
  * Yes, comprehensive plan with regular testing and updates (5)  
  * Yes, documented plan but not regularly tested (3)  
  * Informal or incomplete plan (1)  
  * No formal breach response plan (0)  
     **Tooltip**: A breach response plan outlines steps to take if patient data is compromised. It includes notifying affected patients and regulators. Breaches without a plan can cost 25-40% more and increase penalties. Most practices will face at least one breach, so preparation is essential.  
* **Question ID**: comp-risk-003  
   **Text**: What percentage of your clinical documentation would pass a rigorous third-party audit for compliance with current billing requirements?  
   **Type**: Numeric (0-100)  
   **Tooltip**: Documentation deficiencies are the top cause of claim denials and audits. Many practices overestimate their compliance by 30-50%. For example, missing treatment details can lead to refund demands or fines. A third-party audit can reveal if your records meet payer standards.  
* **Question ID**: comp-risk-004  
   **Text**: Do you regularly conduct mock audits of high-risk compliance areas, and if so, how often?  
   **Type**: Multiple Choice  
   **Options**:  
  * Yes, quarterly mock audits with formal process (5)  
  * Yes, twice yearly mock audits (4)  
  * Yes, annual mock audits (3)  
  * Irregular or sporadic mock audits (1)  
  * No mock audits conducted (0)  
     **Tooltip**: Mock audits help identify compliance issues before real auditors do. Practices with regular mock audits reduce penalties by 60-80%. For example, a mock audit might catch improper billing codes, preventing costly recoupments.  
* **Question ID**: comp-risk-005  
   **Text**: What percentage of your total revenue is at risk if your top compliance vulnerability were discovered in an audit?  
   **Type**: Multiple Choice  
   **Options**:  
  * \<5% of revenue at risk (5)  
  * 5-10% of revenue at risk (4)  
  * 11-25% of revenue at risk (3)  
  * 26-50% of revenue at risk (1)

50% of revenue at risk or unknown (0)

* **Tooltip**: Compliance violations can lead to recoupments across years of claims. Many practices underestimate their exposure. For example, incorrect coding for a common service could risk a large portion of revenue if audited.

## **Financial Health Module**

### **Cash Flow Planning Questions**

* **Question ID**: fin-cash-001  
   **Text**: What is your practice's current accounts receivable aging profile?  
   **Type**: Multiple Choice  
   **Options**:  
  * 90% of AR under 30 days, \<2% over 90 days (5)

  * 80% of AR under 30 days, \<5% over 90 days (4)

  * 70% of AR under 30 days, \<10% over 90 days (3)

  * \<70% of AR under 30 days, 10-20% over 90 days (1)  
  * \<60% of AR under 30 days, \>20% over 90 days or don't track (0)  
     **Tooltip**: Accounts receivable (AR) aging shows how quickly you're paid. The longer bills go unpaid, the less likely you'll collect them. For example, bills over 90 days have less than a 50% chance of payment. Check your AR aging report in your practice management software.  
* **Question ID**: fin-cash-002  
   **Text**: What is your practice's minimum cash reserve policy (expressed as months of operating expenses)?  
   **Type**: Multiple Choice  
   **Options**:  
  * ≥6 months of operating expenses (5)  
  * 4-5 months of operating expenses (4)  
  * 3 months of operating expenses (3)  
  * 1-2 months of operating expenses (1)  
  * \<1 month or no formal cash reserve policy (0)  
     **Tooltip**: Cash reserves protect against revenue disruptions. Practices with less than 3 months' reserves are 4x more likely to face financial distress during business disruptions.  
* **Question ID**: fin-cash-003  
   **Text**: How advanced is your practice's cash flow forecasting process?  
   **Type**: Multiple Choice  
   **Options**:  
  * Rolling 12-month forecast updated weekly with variance analysis and scenario planning (5)  
  * 6-month forecast updated monthly with basic variance tracking (4)  
  * 3-month simple forecast updated quarterly (2)  
  * Annual forecast with no regular updates (1)  
  * No formal cash flow forecasting (0)  
     **Tooltip**: Cash flow forecasting helps you anticipate and manage cash shortfalls. Practices with weekly forecasting identify issues 45-60 days earlier than those with monthly or quarterly forecasting.  
* **Question ID**: fin-cash-004  
   **Text**: What percentage of your patient responsibility amounts are collected at time of service?  
   **Type**: Multiple Choice  
   **Options**:  
  * ≥90% collected at time of service (5)  
  * 75-89% collected at time of service (4)  
  * 50-74% collected at time of service (2)  
  * 25-49% collected at time of service (1)  
  * \<25% collected at time of service or don't track (0)  
     **Tooltip**: Collecting payments at the time of service improves cash flow and reduces AR work. Each 10% improvement in collections reduces AR days by 3-5 days and boosts collection rates by 5-7%.  
* **Question ID**: fin-cash-005  
   **Text**: How do you manage payer mix to optimize cash flow timing and stability?  
   **Type**: Multiple Choice  
   **Options**:

   **Options**:  
  * \<40% overhead ratio (5)  
  * 40-49% overhead ratio (4)  
  * 50-59% overhead ratio (3)  
  * 60-69% overhead ratio (1)  
  * ≥70% overhead ratio or don't track (0)  
     **Tooltip**: Overhead ratio shows what percentage of income goes to running costs before paying practitioners. Lower ratios mean more money for practitioner pay or profit. Successful practices keep overhead under 45%.  
* **Question ID**: fin-exp-002  
   **Text**: How frequently do you analyze expense variances against budget by category?  
   **Type**: Multiple Choice  
   **Options**:  
  * Weekly with formal variance analysis and action plans (5)  
  * Monthly with formal variance analysis and action plans (4)  
  * Quarterly review of major expenses (2)  
  * Annual or sporadic review (1)  
  * No formal expense analysis or no budget (0)  
     **Tooltip**: Regular expense analysis enables rapid cost control. Practices with weekly monitoring identify and address cost overruns 3-4x faster.  
* **Question ID**: fin-exp-003  
   **Text**: Do you have a formal procurement process with competitive bidding for major expenses?  
   **Type**: Multiple Choice  
   **Options**:  
  * Yes, comprehensive procurement system with bidding, approval workflows, and vendor performance metrics (5)  
  * Yes, basic procurement process with some competitive bidding (3)  
  * Informal process with occasional price comparison (1)  
  * No formal procurement process (0)  
     **Tooltip**: Formal procurement reduces supply costs by 15-25%. Many practices overpay by 20-30% due to poor procurement.  
* **Question ID**: fin-exp-004  
   **Text**: How do you manage discretionary spending and staff expense reimbursements?  
   **Type**: Multiple Choice  
   **Options**:  
  * Comprehensive policy with pre-approval workflows, digital receipts, and monthly audits (5)  
  * Formal policy with approval thresholds and receipt requirements (3)  
  * Basic policy with minimal controls (1)  
  * No formal expense policy or controls (0)  
     **Tooltip**: Uncontrolled discretionary spending can account for 5-10% of expenses. Strong controls reduce spending by 30-40%.  
* **Question ID**: fin-exp-005  
   **Text**: Do you utilize a zero-based budgeting approach requiring justification for all expenses each budget cycle?  
   **Type**: Multiple Choice  
   **Options**:  
  * Yes, comprehensive zero-based budgeting with ROI analysis for all major expenses (5)  
  * Partial implementation for selected expense categories (3)  
  * Attempted but inconsistently implemented (1)  
  * No zero-based budgeting or formal budget process (0)  
     **Tooltip**: Zero-based budgeting eliminates legacy spending. Practices implementing this approach reduce expenses by 15-25% in the first year.

### **Revenue Tracking Questions**

* **Question ID**: fin-rev-001  
   **Text**: What is your practice's current debt-to-revenue ratio?  
   **Type**: Numeric (0-100)  
   **Tooltip**: This ratio shows financial health. High ratios (\>40%) indicate dangerous leverage levels. For example, if debt is $100,000 and revenue is $200,000, the ratio is 50%, signaling risk.  
* **Question ID**: fin-rev-002  
   **Text**: How often do you analyze your revenue per practitioner hour and compare it to your actual labor costs?  
   **Type**: Multiple Choice  
   **Options**:  
  * Weekly with formal review (5)  
  * Monthly with formal review (4)  
  * Quarterly with formal review (3)  
  * Annually or less frequently (1)  
  * Never done this analysis (0)  
     **Tooltip**: This analysis reveals unprofitable practitioners or services. For example, if a practitioner generates $150/hour but costs $100/hour, they are profitable.  
* **Question ID**: fin-rev-003  
   **Text**: What percentage of your invoices remain unpaid after 60 days?  
   **Type**: Numeric (0-100)  
   **Tooltip**: Aging receivables drain cash flow. High percentages (\>15%) indicate billing or client selection issues. For example, if 20% of invoices are unpaid after 60 days, you may need stricter payment terms.  
* **Question ID**: fin-rev-004  
   **Text**: Do you know the exact profit margin for each specific service you offer, including allocated overhead?  
   **Type**: Multiple Choice  
   **Options**:  
  * Yes, with comprehensive activity-based costing for all services (5)  
  * Yes, but with estimated overhead allocation (3)  
  * Only for major service categories, not individual services (2)  
  * Only track overall practice margins, not by service (1)  
  * Don't track profit margins by service (0)  
     **Tooltip**: Without service-level profitability, you may subsidize unprofitable services. For example, if a service costs $100 to provide but only brings in $90, it's a loss.  
* **Question ID**: fin-rev-005  
   **Text**: What is your practice's current cash reserve in terms of months of operating expenses?  
   **Type**: Numeric (0-24)  
   **Tooltip**: Cash reserves are your lifeline during downturns. Insufficient reserves (\<3 months) put your practice at risk. For example, with $50,000 monthly expenses, you need at least $150,000 in reserves.

  * Comprehensive analysis (costs, market rates, value, practitioner expertise, competitive positioning) (5)  
  * Market rates and cost analysis (4)  
  * Primarily market rates (3)  
  * Cost-plus markup only (2)  
  * Arbitrary or historical pricing without recent analysis (0)  
     **Tooltip**: Pricing without data leads to lost revenue or uncompetitive rates. For example, if competitors charge $100 for a service that costs you $60, you might set your price at $90.  
* **Question ID**: fin-price-002  
   **Text**: When was the last time you raised your prices, and by what percentage?  
   **Type**: Multiple Choice  
   **Options**:  
  * Within past year by 5% or more (5)  
  * Within past year by less than 5% (4)  
  * 1-2 years ago (3)  
  * More than 2 years ago (1)  
  * Never raised prices or don't know (0)  
     **Tooltip**: Failure to adjust prices erodes margins as costs rise. Even small annual increases (3-5%) compound significantly.  
* **Question ID**: fin-price-003  
   **Text**: Do you offer discounts, and if so, what is your documented strategy for when and how they are applied?  
   **Type**: Multiple Choice  
   **Options**:  
  * Strategic discounting with documented rules, approval processes, and ROI tracking (5)  
  * Documented discount policies but limited tracking or analysis (3)  
  * Informal discounting at staff discretion (2)  
  * Inconsistent discounting with no formal policy (1)  
  * No discounts offered (4)  
     **Tooltip**: Uncontrolled discounting erodes margins. Each 1% discount requires 3-4% more volume to maintain profits.  
* **Question ID**: fin-price-004  
   **Text**: What is your highest-margin service, and what percentage of your total revenue does it represent?  
   **Type**: Multiple Choice  
   **Options**:  
  * Know highest margin service and it represents \>30% of revenue (5)  
  * Know highest margin service and it represents 15-30% of revenue (4)  
  * Know highest margin service but it represents \<15% of revenue (3)  
  * Uncertain which service has highest margins (1)  
  * Don't track service-level margins (0)  
     **Tooltip**: Understanding profit drivers is key. For example, if specialized therapy has a 50% margin, focusing on it can boost profitability.  
* **Question ID**: fin-price-005  
   **Text**: Have you ever calculated the lifetime value of your average patient, and if so, how does it compare to your patient acquisition cost?  
   **Type**: Multiple Choice  
   **Options**:  
  * Yes, calculated LTV is \>5x acquisition cost (5)  
  * Yes, calculated LTV is 3-5x acquisition cost (4)  
  * Yes, calculated LTV is \<3x acquisition cost (2)  
  * Only rough estimates without formal calculation (1)  
  * Never calculated either metric (0)  
     **Tooltip**: Patient lifetime value (LTV) should exceed acquisition costs. Low ratios indicate pricing or retention issues. For example, if LTV is $500 and acquisition costs $200, it's healthy.
