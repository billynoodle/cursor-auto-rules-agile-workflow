# Agent Workflow Standards

<version>1.3.0</version>

## Context
- Applied when I am working within the agile framework
- Guides my interaction with stories and tasks
- Ensures consistent development approach
- Maintains project momentum

## Requirements

### 1. Story Analysis Process

#### Initial Assessment
- Read full story requirements
- Review related documentation
- Identify technical constraints
- Validate against architecture
- Check existing test coverage

#### Implementation Planning
- Create test scenarios first
- Break down into subtasks
- Identify potential blockers
- Plan incremental delivery
- Document approach decisions

### 2. Development Workflow

#### Code Changes
- Follow test-driven development
- Make atomic commits
- Update documentation inline
- Add progress comments
- Track technical debt

#### Progress Updates
- Update story status
- Document blockers immediately
- Track completion metrics
- Link related changes
- Record decisions made
- Create daily retrospectives

### 3. Quality Standards

#### Code Quality
- Write tests first
- Follow architecture patterns
- Maintain documentation
- Consider performance
- Handle edge cases

#### Review Process
- Self-review changes
- Update test coverage
- Check acceptance criteria
- Validate dependencies
- Document impact

### 4. Communication Protocol

#### Status Updates
- Use clear, concise language
- Include progress metrics
- Highlight blockers early
- Reference related items
- Provide next steps

#### Technical Documentation
- Update inline comments
- Maintain README files
- Document decisions
- Link related changes
- Explain trade-offs

### 5. Retrospective Management

#### Daily Retrospectives
- Create using template
- Document all sections:
  - What Went Well
  - What Could Be Improved
  - Action Items
  - Learnings
  - Next Steps
  - Metrics Summary
  - Dependencies Update
  - Notes for Tomorrow
- Store in .ai/sprints/retrospectives/
- Track action items
- Monitor improvements

#### Sprint Retrospectives
- Create at sprint end
- Analyze sprint metrics
- Document key learnings
- Plan improvements
- Update templates if needed

## Examples

### Effective Story Implementation
```markdown
Analyzing story AUTH-2: Password Reset...

1. Requirements Analysis:
   - User story reviewed
   - Dependencies checked
   - Architecture validated
   - Constraints identified

2. Implementation Plan:
   - Write password reset tests
   - Implement email service
   - Add reset endpoints
   - Update documentation

3. Progress Tracking:
   - Story points: 5
   - Status: In Progress
   - Blockers: None
   - Next: Email integration

4. Technical Decisions:
   - Using JWT for tokens
   - 24h expiry period
   - Rate limiting added

5. Daily Retrospective:
   - Progress documented
   - Learnings captured
   - Next steps planned
   - Metrics updated
```

### Ineffective Implementation
<example type="invalid">
Starting work on auth...
Making some changes...
Will add tests later...
No retrospective needed...
</example>

## Critical Notes
- NEVER skip requirements analysis
- ALWAYS write tests first
- NEVER leave progress untracked
- ALWAYS document decisions
- NEVER ignore blockers
- ALWAYS validate against architecture
- NEVER skip daily retrospectives
- ALWAYS update story status

## Integration Points
- Follow @852-agile-management for agile standards
- Follow @853-sprint-workflow for sprint management
- Store progress in .ai/epics/*/stories/*/
- Track epics in .ai/epics/
- Maintain sprints in .ai/sprints/
- Keep retrospectives in .ai/sprints/retrospectives/
- Access rules in .cursor/rules/
