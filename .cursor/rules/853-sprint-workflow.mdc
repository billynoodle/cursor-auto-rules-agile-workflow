# Sprint Workflow Standards

<version>1.0.0</version>

## Context
- Used when starting a new sprint
- Applied during sprint planning
- Referenced for daily progress
- Guides sprint completion

## Requirements

### Sprint Initialization
```markdown
1. Create sprint file:
   .ai/sprints/SPRINT-{N}.md

2. Set sprint metadata:
   - Sprint Number: N
   - Start Date: YYYY-MM-DD
   - End Date: YYYY-MM-DD
   - Story Points Target: X
   - Team Capacity: Y story points
   - Focus Areas: [list key objectives]

3. Link active stories:
   - Reference stories from .ai/epics/epic-{N}/stories/
   - Update story status in both sprint and epic files
   - Set sprint assignments
   - Check dependencies
   - Update epic progress tracking

4. Create burndown chart:
   ```mermaid
   gantt
       title Sprint Burndown
       dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD
       axisFormat %d
       section Points
       Ideal    : milestone, 0, 0d
       Current  : milestone, 0, 0d
   ```

5. Set up daily tracking:
   - Progress updates section
   - Blocker tracking
   - Velocity metrics
   - Team notes
```

### Daily Operations
```markdown
1. Update sprint status:
   - Mark completed stories
   - Update story points
   - Record blockers
   - Update burndown
   - Sync epic story status

2. Check sprint health:
   - Velocity vs target
   - Blocker resolution
   - Dependencies status
   - Risk assessment
   - Epic alignment check

3. Plan next actions:
   - Priority stories
   - Blocker resolution
   - Team coordination
   - Resource needs
   - Epic progress review
```

### Sprint Completion
```markdown
1. Finalize metrics:
   - Stories completed
   - Points delivered
   - Velocity achieved
   - Quality metrics

2. Create daily retrospective:
   - Use template from .ai/sprints/retrospectives/template.md
   - Document in .ai/sprints/retrospectives/YYYY-MM-DD-retro.md
   - Required sections:
     - What Went Well (progress, quality, process)
     - What Could Be Improved (technical, process, dependencies)
     - Action Items (immediate, short-term, long-term)
     - Learnings (technical, process, risk management)
     - Next Steps (priorities and improvements)
     - Metrics Summary (sprint, quality, components, docs)
     - Dependencies Update (external and internal)
     - Notes for Tomorrow (focus areas and preparation)

3. Archive sprint:
   - Move to completed
   - Update epic progress
   - Link retrospective
   - Record learnings
```

## Examples

### Effective Sprint Initialization
```markdown
# Sprint-2: Authentication System Implementation

## Metadata
- Sprint: 2
- Start: 2024-03-18
- End: 2024-04-01
- Points Target: 34
- Team Capacity: 40 points
- Focus: User Authentication

## Stories
- [ ] EPIC-1/STORY-1: Login System (13 points)
  - Location: .ai/epics/epic-1/stories/story-1/
  - Implementation Status: In Progress
- [ ] EPIC-1/STORY-2: Password Reset (8 points)
  - Location: .ai/epics/epic-1/stories/story-2/
  - Implementation Status: Not Started
- [ ] EPIC-2/STORY-1: 2FA Setup (13 points)
  - Location: .ai/epics/epic-2/stories/story-1/
  - Implementation Status: Not Started

## Sprint Goals
1. Complete core authentication
2. Implement security features
3. Set up monitoring

## Progress Tracking
### Day 1 (2024-03-18)
- Started EPIC-1/STORY-1
- Environment setup complete
- No blockers
- Epic-1 progress: 25%
```

### Ineffective Sprint Start
<example type="invalid">
# Sprint 2
- Do auth stuff
- Maybe add security
- Will track progress later
</example>

## Critical Notes
- NEVER start without clear goals
- ALWAYS set measurable targets
- NEVER skip daily updates
- ALWAYS track blockers
- NEVER leave metrics blank
- ALWAYS plan next actions
- NEVER ignore dependencies
- ALWAYS document decisions
- NEVER skip retrospectives
- ALWAYS use retrospective template
- NEVER leave retrospective sections empty
- ALWAYS track retrospective action items
