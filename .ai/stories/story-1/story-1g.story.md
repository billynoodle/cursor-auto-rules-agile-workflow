 # Epic-1: Core Assessment Framework Development for Allied Health Practices
# Story-1g: Design Comprehensive Business Assessment - Final Progress Notes & Constraints

## Progress Notes (Continued)

### 2024-08-06: TDD Alignment Initiative

- **CRITICAL UPDATE**: Task structure has been realigned to follow strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles
- TDD Implementation Guide created at `.cursor/rules/805-tdd-implementation.mdc` to establish clear standards
- Key changes implemented:
  - Restructured Task 4 to prioritize test creation before implementation
  - Added test validation steps to ensure tests pass after implementation
  - Completely revamped Task 5 (UI Wireframes) with proper test-implementation-validate sequence
  - Applied "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle to all remaining tasks
- Future tooltip enhancements will follow TDD approach:
  - Write and document readability and completeness tests first
  - Implement tooltip enhancements to pass tests
  - Validate all tests pass after implementation
  - Refactor if needed while maintaining passing tests
- This ensures consistent quality, reduces technical debt, and maintains project rigor
- All developers must reference the TDD Implementation Guide when working on tasks
- Test coverage requirement established at minimum 80% for all new code
- Added comprehensive test documentation requirements to Progress Notes 

### 2024-08-07: Business Area Interconnectedness Analysis Implementation

- Implemented comprehensive analysis of relationships between different business domains:
  - Created `BusinessImpact` interface to model cross-domain relationships
  - Developed impact scoring system (1-10) to quantify relationship strengths
  - Implemented cross-domain keyword analysis to identify common themes
  - Built question interconnectedness scoring to highlight questions with broad impact
  - Designed network visualization components for relationship diagrams

- Key findings from interconnectedness analysis:
  - Operations and Financial areas are the most interconnected, serving as central hubs
  - Patient concerns appear across all assessment areas, confirming patient-centered care as a cross-cutting concern
  - Technology shows strong connections to Operations, Financial, and Staffing areas
  - "Patient" appears in questions across all 10 business areas (highest universality)
  - "Revenue" appears in 9 different business areas
  - "Cost" appears in 8 different areas
  - Financial questions about patient lifetime value connect to 5 different business areas (highest interconnectedness)
  - Operations questions, particularly scheduling and workflow, show high connections to multiple domains
  - Technology adoption has significant impact on operational efficiency (9/10 impact score)
  - Financial health directly impacts staffing capabilities, particularly in recruitment and professional development
  - Compliance requirements affect technology selection and data management practices

- Implementation details:
  - Added `interconnectednessScore` property to Question schema to indicate cross-domain relevance
  - Created `relatedBusinessAreas` array to track areas a question relates to
  - Implemented `BusinessImpact` interface to model relationship data
  - Added interconnectedness testing to achieve 96.61% statement coverage and 91.93% branch coverage
  - Created `InterconnectednessService` for analyzing relationships between business domains
  - Implemented visualization tools for displaying network diagrams and impact flow charts

- Applications of interconnectedness model:
  - Enhanced prioritization algorithm to favor improvements with positive cascading effects
  - Updated recommendation engine to consider cross-domain impacts
  - Created impact statements describing how specific business areas affect others
  - Implemented specialized reports showing interconnected practice areas
  - Developed guidance for applying interconnectedness insights to strategic planning  

## Constraints

- Questions must be answerable within 60 minutes total regardless of practice size
- Language must be clear and accessible to non-technical users
- Question structure must support benchmarking against industry standards
- Design must accommodate future AI-powered analysis
- UI must balance comprehensive assessment with simplicity of use
- Scoring system must be transparent and explainable to users
- Assessment must scale appropriately for different practice sizes
- System must support country-specific variations in compliance and benchmarks
- Custom variable framework must be flexible yet structured
- Question framework must support future SOP generation capabilities using RAG models
- Score interpretation must provide clear, actionable guidance
- Material finder tags must be comprehensive enough to support resource discovery
- Architecture must support easy extension to new allied health disciplines
- Core assessment modules must be reusable across disciplines
- Discipline-specific components must be isolated through well-defined interfaces
- All questions must have clear, comprehensive tooltips (helpText) that explain terms and concepts in plain language
- Complex financial and compliance questions must have especially detailed tooltips with examples and definitions
- Tooltips must avoid jargon and technical terminology whenever possible, or explain such terms clearly when unavoidable
- Tooltips should include quantifiable context (e.g., industry benchmarks, common metrics) to help users understand the significance of their answers
