### 2024-08-04: Enhanced Question Tooltips and Accessibility

- Updated requirements to emphasize the importance of comprehensive, jargon-free tooltips for all questions
- Identified need for enhanced tooltip development with particular focus on:
  - Financial questions: Adding clear explanations of financial metrics, ratios, and accounting concepts
  - Compliance questions: Providing plain-language explanations of regulatory requirements and standards
  - Technical questions: Simplifying technology concepts for practitioners without technical backgrounds
- Added new tasks (4.14-4.17) focused specifically on tooltip development and testing
- Revised Question Schema to emphasize helpText as an essential tooltip feature with specific guidelines:
  - Must use plain language accessible to non-technical users
  - Should avoid jargon or clearly explain technical terms when necessary
  - Must include relevant metrics and contextual information
  - Should explain why the question matters to the practice's success
  - For complex topics, must provide comprehensive explanations with examples
- Established tooltip review process to ensure all explanations meet accessibility standards
- Determined need for user testing of tooltips with practitioners from various backgrounds
- Prioritized complex financial and compliance questions for enhanced tooltip development
- Identified financial topics requiring special attention:
  - Overhead ratio calculations and significance
  - Cash flow management concepts
  - Revenue cycle metrics
  - Profit margin analysis
  - Expense categorization
- All tooltips will include quantifiable context (industry benchmarks, metrics, etc.) to help users understand the significance of their answers
