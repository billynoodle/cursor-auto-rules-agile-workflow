 # Epic-1: Core Assessment Framework Development for Allied Health Practices
# Story-1a: Design Comprehensive Business Assessment Questionnaire Structure with Weighted Scoring System for Allied Health Practices (Initial Focus: Physiotherapy)

## Story

**As an** allied health practitioner (initially focusing on physiotherapists)
**I want** a comprehensive business assessment questionnaire with quantifiable metrics that scales to my practice size
**so that** I can identify key areas for improvement in my practice with concrete, data-driven insights relevant to my specific context

In Progress

## Context

This is the first story in Epic-1 which focuses on developing the core assessment framework for the Allied Health Business Assessment Tool. The MVP will specifically target physiotherapy practices as the initial discipline before expanding to other allied health fields in future phases. The questionnaire structure is the foundation of the entire assessment process and will inform all subsequent development. The questionnaire needs to cover all major aspects of an allied health practice including financial health, operations, marketing, staffing, compliance, patient/client management, facilities, geographic considerations, technology integration, and automation opportunities.

A key requirement is that the assessment must provide quantifiable metrics through a weighted scoring system while maintaining simplicity and ease of use. The scoring system will enable practitioners to benchmark their performance against industry standards specific to their country (with Australia as the default) and track improvements over time with flexible tracking periods appropriate to each metric. The assessment must also scale appropriately based on practice size and complexity, from solo practitioners to multi-location practices.

Additionally, the assessment framework needs to be designed with future SOP generation capabilities in mind, ensuring that question responses can be mapped to relevant SOP templates for areas like practitioner onboarding, health screening protocols, compliance procedures, and other key practice processes. The system should support RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) models for SOP creation and include metadata to support the SOP material finder feature that will help users locate relevant resources for creating comprehensive SOPs.

The framework must also include a score interpretation system that provides practitioners with a clear overview of their practice's position and specific action prompts based on their assessment results.

While the initial implementation will focus exclusively on physiotherapy practices, the architecture must be designed to easily accommodate other allied health disciplines in future phases without significant refactoring.

Our analysis has revealed the critical importance of understanding the interconnectedness between different business areas. The assessment framework must be designed to identify and analyze these relationships, showing practitioners how changes in one area can impact others. This interconnectedness model will help practitioners make more holistic decisions by understanding the ripple effects of their business strategies across all practice areas.
