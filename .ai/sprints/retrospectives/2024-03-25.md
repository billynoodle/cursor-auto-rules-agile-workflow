# Daily Retrospective - March 25, 2024

## What Went Well
- Completed comprehensive analysis of AssessmentPage.tsx component
- Identified all unused assessment components
- Mapped component dependencies and relationships
- Discovered gaps in component integration
- Identified missing state management patterns

## What Could Be Improved
- AssessmentPage.tsx missing critical component integrations:
  - QuestionPresentation not used for question rendering
  - ProgressTracker not integrated for progress visualization
  - CountrySelector and PracticeSizeSelector missing from setup flow
  - ResultsPresentation and ScoreVisualization not implemented
  - CustomVariableCreator not integrated
- Missing phase management in assessment flow
- Incomplete state management for:
  - Practice configuration
  - Assessment completion
  - Results data
  - Custom variables
- No clear component lifecycle management
- Missing proper component dependencies

## Action Items
- [ ] Implement phase management system:
  1. Add AssessmentPhase type and state
  2. Create phase transition logic
  3. Implement phase-based rendering
- [ ] Add missing state management:
  1. Practice configuration state
  2. Results state
  3. Custom variables state
  4. Component lifecycle state
- [ ] Create proper component flow:
  1. Setup phase with configuration components
  2. Assessment phase with progress tracking
  3. Results phase with visualizations
- [ ] Set up component dependencies:
  1. Integrate QuestionPresentation
  2. Add ProgressTracker
  3. Implement CountrySelector and PracticeSizeSelector
  4. Add ResultsPresentation and ScoreVisualization
  5. Integrate CustomVariableCreator
- [ ] Update test coverage for new integrations
- [ ] Document component relationships and dependencies

## Learnings
- Component implementation doesn't guarantee integration
- Need for clear phase management in complex flows
- Importance of comprehensive state management
- Critical role of proper component dependencies
- Value of systematic component analysis

## Next Steps
1. Create AssessmentPhase management system
2. Implement missing state management
3. Integrate unused components
4. Update test coverage
5. Document component relationships

## Metrics Summary
- Components Total: 10
- Components Used: 2
- Components Unused: 8
- Integration Coverage: 20%
- Test Coverage Impact: Potential reduction in effective coverage

## Dependencies Update
- New dependencies identified between components
- Phase management dependencies discovered
- State management requirements updated

## Notes for Tomorrow
- Focus on implementing phase management first
- Plan state management implementation
- Prepare component integration strategy
- Consider test coverage implications
- Document all component relationships
