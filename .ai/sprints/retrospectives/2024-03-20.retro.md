# Sprint Retrospective: 2024-03-20

## What Went Well 🎉

### Testing Framework
- Fixed all failing tests in AssessmentService
- Improved mock implementations for Supabase operations
- Enhanced error handling test coverage
- Added new test suites bringing total to 17
- Increased total test count to 206 passing tests

### Technical Progress
- Successfully updated AssessmentService test implementation
- Fixed mock chain for Supabase upsert operations
- Improved error handling in AssessmentFlowController
- Enhanced integration test coverage
- Maintained consistent code quality

### Documentation
- Updated sprint documentation with latest metrics
- Added detailed test statistics
- Documented test fixes and improvements
- Tracked progress against sprint goals

## What Could Be Improved 🔨

### Test Coverage
- Branch coverage at 75.96%, below 80% target
- Need more test cases for edge conditions
- Some error paths still need coverage
- Integration test coverage could be expanded

### Technical Debt
- Still need to implement retry mechanism
- Logging system improvements pending
- Error recovery mechanisms need enhancement
- Performance monitoring setup required

### Process
- Need better tracking of test coverage metrics
- Could improve documentation of test fixes
- Better organization of test improvements needed

## Action Items for Tomorrow 📋

### Test Coverage Improvement
1. Priority Areas:
   - Identify uncovered branches
   - Add tests for edge cases
   - Expand error handling coverage
   - Enhance integration tests

2. Implementation Plan:
   - Review coverage reports
   - Create test cases for gaps
   - Focus on critical paths first
   - Document coverage improvements

### Technical Debt
1. Focus Areas:
   - Retry mechanism design
   - Logging system enhancement
   - Error recovery implementation
   - Performance monitoring setup

2. Implementation Order:
   - Start with retry mechanism
   - Add enhanced logging
   - Implement error recovery
   - Setup monitoring last

## Success Metrics for Tomorrow 📊
