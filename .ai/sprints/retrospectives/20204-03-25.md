# Daily Retrospective - Day 3

## What Went Well
- Successfully implemented practice size selection component
- Added state persistence using localStorage
- Improved component rendering performance
- Added clear assessment functionality

## What Could Be Improved
Test failures identified in AssessmentPage component:
1. Missing data-testid for current category display
2. State management issues with practice size selection
3. Error handling test failures
4. Component visibility issues during transitions

## Action Items
1. Add missing data-testid attributes to category display
2. Fix state management in practice size selection
3. Improve error handling test coverage
4. Add transition states for component visibility
5. Update test suite to handle localStorage mocking

## Learnings
- State persistence between refreshes requires careful consideration of initialization
- Component visibility transitions need explicit test coverage
- Test IDs should be added during initial component development

## Next Steps
1. Fix identified test failures:
   - Add data-testid="current-category" to category display
   - Update error handling tests to account for practice size selection
   - Add proper state transitions in tests
2. Implement proper localStorage mocking in tests
3. Add transition states between components
4. Update test coverage for new functionality

## Metrics Summary
- Total Tests: 265
- Passed: 257
- Failed: 8
- Test Coverage: ~97%
- Components Completed: PracticeSizeSelector, AssessmentPage updates
- Outstanding Issues: 4 major test failures

## Dependencies Update
- No new dependencies added
- All existing dependencies working as expected

## Notes for Tomorrow
- Focus on fixing test failures first
- Consider adding loading states during transitions
- Review error handling implementation
- Consider adding visual feedback for state changes
