# Daily Retrospective - March 21, 2024

## What Went Well
- Successfully implemented the core assessment service classes (`AssessmentDataService`, `AnswerService`)
- Implemented offline support functionality
- Created comprehensive test files for all services
- Established proper error handling with `AssessmentError`
- Set up validation using Zod schemas
- Successfully consolidated mock files into centralized directory structure
- Created clear organization for service and data mocks
- Improved mock file discoverability
- Improved type definitions for Supabase mocks
- Created better mock implementation structure
- Cleaned up old mock files after consolidation
- Created comprehensive mock data generators
- Added tests for mock implementations
- Improved type safety in mock implementations

## What Could Be Improved
- Test mocks for Supabase client need better type definitions
- Mock implementations for offline service need refinement
- Test coverage is currently below the required 80% threshold
- Some TypeScript errors in test files need resolution
- Mock files are scattered across different directories
- Import paths need to be updated across all test files
- Some TypeScript errors persist after mock consolidation
- Need to ensure consistent mock implementations
- Mock type definitions need further refinement
- Need to handle complex Supabase types better
- Need to verify all old mock files are removed
- Need to fix remaining TypeScript errors in mock generators
- Need to improve error handling in mock implementations

## Action Items
- [ ] Fix TypeScript errors in `AnswerService.test.ts`
- [x] Update Supabase mock implementation to properly handle query builder chain
- [ ] Improve test coverage for `AssessmentDataService`
- [ ] Resolve offline service mock type issues
- [ ] Add missing test cases for edge conditions
- [x] Consolidate mocks into centralized directory structure:
  1. ✓ Create new `tests/__mocks__` directory structure
  2. ✓ Move Supabase mocks to `__mocks__/services/supabase/`
  3. ✓ Move offline service mocks to `__mocks__/services/offline/`
  4. ✓ Move assessment data mocks to `__mocks__/data/assessment/`
  5. ✓ Create error scenario mocks in `__mocks__/data/errors/`
  6. [ ] Update all import paths in test files
  7. ✓ Add index files for better organization
  8. [x] Update mock-related documentation
  9. ✓ Clean up old mock files
- [ ] Improve Supabase mock types:
  1. ✓ Create proper type definitions
  2. ✓ Implement query builder chain
  3. [ ] Fix remaining type issues
  4. [x] Add comprehensive tests for mock implementation
- [x] Create mock data generators:
  1. ✓ Assessment data generators
  2. ✓ Answer data generators
  3. ✓ Response generators
  4. [ ] Fix TypeScript errors in generators

## Learnings
- Supabase query builder requires careful mocking due to its chained method pattern
- Offline storage implementation needs robust type checking
- Jest mocks require explicit typing for complex database operations
- Centralized mock organization improves maintainability
- Index files help with clean imports
- Need to handle complex type definitions in mock implementations
- Supabase's type system requires careful handling
- Mock implementations need strong typing for reliability
- Generator functions improve test data consistency
- Comprehensive mock testing prevents regression issues

## Next Steps
1. Update mock implementations to fix TypeScript errors
2. Add missing test cases to improve coverage
3. Refactor test setup for better maintainability
4. Document mock patterns for future reference
5. Complete import path updates
6. Create mock usage guidelines
7. Improve Supabase mock type definitions
8. Add tests for mock implementations
9. Verify no duplicate mock files remain
10. Fix TypeScript errors in mock generators
11. Add error handling test cases

## Metrics Summary
- Test Coverage: 75.24% statements (target: 80%)
- Test Coverage: 38.88% branches (target: 80%)
- Test Coverage: 78.26% functions (target: 80%)
- Test Coverage: 74.48% lines (target: 80%)
- Failed Tests: 4
- Passed Tests: 19
- Total Tests: 23

## Dependencies Update
- No new dependencies added
- Current dependencies working as expected
- Supabase client version compatibility maintained

## Notes for Tomorrow
- Focus on fixing TypeScript errors in test files
- Review test coverage gaps
- Consider adding integration tests
- Document mock patterns for team reference
- Complete mock consolidation process
- Create mock usage guidelines
- Fix remaining import paths
- Address TypeScript errors in mock implementations
- Improve Supabase mock type system
- Add tests for mock implementations
- Fix TypeScript errors in generators
- Add error handling test cases
- Review mock implementation patterns
