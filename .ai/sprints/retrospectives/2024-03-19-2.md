# Daily Retrospective - March 19, 2024 (Afternoon)

## What Went Well
- Successfully fixed all failing tests in AssessmentFlowController.init.test.ts
- Improved error handling validation order in saveAnswer method
- Added proper module structure validation in create method
- Enhanced test organization with clear sections
- All 6 test cases now passing with proper error messages

## What Could Be Improved
- Consider adding more edge cases for module validation
- Could add performance tests for large module structures
- Consider adding validation for module metadata
- Documentation could be more detailed for error scenarios

## Action Items
1. Review other controller test files for similar validation issues
2. Add performance test cases for large assessments
3. Document error handling patterns in architecture docs
4. Update test coverage metrics

## Learnings
- Order of validation checks is crucial for proper error messages
- Module structure validation should be comprehensive
- Test organization improves maintainability
- Using test data generators increases test reliability

## Next Steps
1. Update AssessmentFlowController.navigation.test.ts
2. Update AssessmentFlowController.progress.test.ts
3. Add performance test cases
4. Update architecture documentation

## Metrics Summary
- Tests: 6 passing (100%)
- Coverage: Improved error handling paths
- Validation: Added 2 new validation checks
- Organization: 3 clear test sections

## Dependencies Update
- No external dependencies affected
- Internal test utilities working well
- Mock data generators functioning correctly

## Notes for Tomorrow
- Focus on navigation test improvements
- Consider adding stress tests
- Review error handling documentation
- Update test coverage metrics
