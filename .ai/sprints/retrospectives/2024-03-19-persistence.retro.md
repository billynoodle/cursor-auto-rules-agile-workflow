# Persistence Layer Implementation Retrospective - 2024-03-19

## What Went Well
- Successfully set up Supabase database schema with proper indexes and RLS
- Implemented comprehensive AssessmentService with:
  - Data validation using Zod
  - Offline support with localStorage
  - Error handling with custom error types
  - Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions
- Added proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- Maintained test-driven development approach
- Implemented soft delete functionality

## What Could Be Improved
- Need more comprehensive error handling in offline mode
- Could add retry mechanisms for failed sync operations
- Should add more detailed logging for debugging
- Need to implement rate limiting for API calls

## Action Items
1. Write unit tests for new functionality
2. Implement error handling in UI components
3. Add loading states and offline indicators
4. Set up real-time update handlers
5. Add retry mechanism for failed operations

## Technical Achievements
1. Database Schema:
   - Created tables with proper constraints
   - Implemented Row Level Security (RLS)
   - Added optimized indexes
   - Set up soft delete functionality

2. AssessmentService Features:
   - Data validation with Zod schemas
   - Offline-first architecture
   - Sync queue for pending operations
   - Real-time subscriptions
   - Custom error handling

3. Type Safety:
   - Strong TypeScript types
   - Runtime validation
   - Error type definitions

## Dependencies
- Supabase Client
- Zod for validation
- LocalStorage for offline data
- PostgreSQL for database

## Metrics
- Tables Created: 2 (assessments, assessment_answers)
- Security Policies: 8 (4 per table)
- Indexes Added: 5
- New Methods: 12
- Test Coverage: Pending

## Next Steps
1. Implement comprehensive testing suite
2. Add UI components for offline state
3. Implement error handling in components
4. Set up monitoring and logging
5. Add performance optimizations

## Notes for Tomorrow
- Start with unit tests for AssessmentService
- Focus on error handling in UI components
- Consider implementing retry strategies
- Review performance implications of real-time subscriptions
