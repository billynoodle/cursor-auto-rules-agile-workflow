# Daily Retrospective - March 19, 2024

## What Went Well
- Successfully improved test coverage for assessment services
- Added comprehensive error handling test cases
- Fixed TypeScript errors in test files
- Achieved overall branch coverage of 77.65% (up from previous)
- Unit tests for `AnswerService` and `AssessmentDataService` are passing with good coverage

## What Could Be Improved
- Branch coverage still below 80% threshold (77.65% vs required 80%)
- Integration tests failing due to missing mock data files
- `AssessmentFlowController` tests failing due to TypeScript errors
- Some components have low branch coverage (e.g., `ResultsPresentation.tsx` at 54.54%)

## Action Items
1. Create missing mock data files:
   - `./__mocks__/mockData` for integration tests
   - `../controllers/__mocks__/mockData` for AssessmentService tests

2. Fix TypeScript errors:
   - Add `getCurrentState` method to `AssessmentFlowController`
   - Fix type definitions in navigation tests

3. Improve branch coverage:
   - Add tests for `ResultsPresentation.tsx` edge cases
   - Cover remaining branches in `AssessmentDataService.ts` (lines 100, 104, 111)
   - Add tests for `AnswerService.ts` line 39

## Learnings
- Mock data organization needs better structure
- Integration tests require more robust test data setup
- Error handling scenarios need comprehensive coverage
- Component tests should focus more on edge cases

## Next Steps
1. Create a centralized mock data management system
2. Implement missing mock data files
3. Fix TypeScript errors in controller tests
4. Add tests for uncovered branches
5. Review and improve component test coverage

## Metrics Summary
- Total Tests: 246
- Passing Tests: 245
- Failing Tests: 1
- Overall Branch Coverage: 77.65%
- Files Needing Attention: 8
- Critical Issues: 3 (TypeScript errors, missing mocks, coverage threshold)

## Dependencies Update
- No external dependencies affected
- Internal dependencies between tests and mock data need resolution

## Notes for Tomorrow
- Focus on fixing integration test setup first
- Then address TypeScript errors in controller tests
- Finally work on improving branch coverage
- Consider creating a shared mock data library
