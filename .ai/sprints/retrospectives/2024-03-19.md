# Daily Retrospective - March 19, 2024

## What Went Well
- Successfully updated AssessmentFlowController test files:
  - navigation.test.ts
  - progress.test.ts
  - error.test.ts
  - state.test.ts
- Improved test organization and readability
- Fixed TypeScript errors and removed unused imports
- Better error handling coverage
- Implemented dynamic module generation in test context

## What Could Be Improved
- Some test files still need updating (init.test.ts)
- Component coverage remains below target
- AssessmentService branch coverage is still low (37.68%)

## Action Items
1. Update AssessmentFlowController.init.test.ts
2. Improve component test coverage
3. Add missing branch coverage tests for AssessmentService
4. Review and update remaining test files

## Learnings
- Using dynamic module generation improves test maintainability
- Organizing tests by functionality improves readability
- Proper error handling tests are crucial for reliability
- Test context simplifies test setup and reduces duplication

## Next Steps
1. Update AssessmentFlowController.init.test.ts
2. Add missing branch coverage tests
3. Review component test coverage
4. Update test documentation

## Metrics Summary
- Updated 4 out of 5 controller test files
- Fixed all TypeScript errors in updated files
- Improved test organization and readability
- Added better error handling coverage

## Dependencies Update
- No external dependencies affected
- Internal test context working well
- All updated tests passing

## Notes for Tomorrow
- Start with AssessmentFlowController.init.test.ts
- Focus on improving component coverage
- Review AssessmentService test coverage
- Update documentation as needed
