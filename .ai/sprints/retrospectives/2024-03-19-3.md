## Daily Retrospective - March 19, 2024 (Evening)

### What Went Well
- Executed comprehensive test suite across all components
- Identified specific areas needing improvement in test coverage
- Successfully ran 274 tests with 273 passing
- Maintained high overall statement coverage at 85.11%

### What Could Be Improved
- Branch coverage (77.01%) is below the 80% threshold
- AssessmentService has low branch coverage (37.68%)
- ResultsPresentation component needs better test coverage
- Some TypeScript errors in AssessmentFlowController tests

### Action Items
1. Fix TypeScript errors in AssessmentFlowController tests
   - Add missing getCurrentState method or update tests
2. Improve AssessmentService branch coverage
   - Focus on error handling scenarios
   - Add edge case tests
3. Enhance ResultsPresentation component tests
   - Add branch coverage for conditional rendering
4. Address failing test in AssessmentService
   - Fix "should save answer when online" test

### Learnings
- Identified gaps in error handling coverage
- Found areas where mock data needs improvement
- Discovered potential type definition issues
- Better understanding of offline/online state handling needs

### Next Steps
1. Update AssessmentFlowController interface
2. Add missing test cases for AssessmentService
3. Enhance ResultsPresentation test coverage
4. Fix mock data module imports

### Metrics Summary
- Tests: 273 passing, 1 failing (274 total)
- Statement Coverage: 85.11%
- Branch Coverage: 77.01%
- Function Coverage: 85.81%
- Line Coverage: 85.63%

### Dependencies Update
- No new dependencies required
- Current test framework is functioning well
- Mock data structure needs reorganization

### Notes for Tomorrow
- Focus on fixing TypeScript errors first
- Plan systematic approach for improving branch coverage
- Consider adding more edge case scenarios
- Review error handling patterns across services
