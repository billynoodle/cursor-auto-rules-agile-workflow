# Sprint Retrospective: 2024-03-19

## What Went Well 🎉

### Testing Framework
- Successfully implemented comprehensive testing strategy
- Achieved 16 test suites with 201 passing tests
- Exceeded coverage targets (>80% across critical paths)
- Standardized mock implementations for Supabase and localStorage
- Enhanced error handling and validation testing

### Technical Progress
- Completed AssessmentService implementation
- Added offline support and data persistence
- Implemented comprehensive error handling
- Set up performance testing infrastructure
- Maintained code quality standards

### Documentation
- Updated testing documentation with current practices
- Documented mock implementations and patterns
- Created clear test organization structure
- Updated sprint and story documentation

## What Could Be Improved 🔨

### Documentation Gaps
- Technical documentation still pending
- API interface documentation needed
- Component documentation not started
- Architecture decisions need documentation

### Technical Debt
- Retry mechanism not implemented
- Logging system needs enhancement
- Error recovery mechanisms incomplete
- Performance monitoring needs setup

### Process
- Need clearer definition of documentation requirements
- Better tracking of technical debt items
- More structured approach to architecture decisions

## Action Items for Tomorrow 📋

### Environment Setup
1. Tools Required:
   - VSCode with testing extensions
   - Jest and React Testing Library
   - Supabase CLI for local testing
   - Documentation tools

2. Configuration Needed:
   - Test environment variables
   - Local database setup
   - Mock data preparation
   - Logging configuration

### Technical Preparation
1. Code Review:
   - Review AssessmentFlowController current state
   - Check navigation logic implementation
   - Review state management approach
   - Verify test coverage gaps

2. Development Environment:
   - Clean node_modules if needed
   - Update dependencies
   - Clear test cache
   - Prepare mock data

### Documentation Needs
1. Templates Required:
   - Component documentation template
   - API interface documentation template
   - Architecture decision records
   - Test strategy documentation

2. Reference Materials:
   - Current test coverage reports
   - Existing component specifications
   - API design documents
   - Architecture diagrams

## Starting Points for Tomorrow 🎯

### Morning Session (Flow Controller)
1. Files to Focus On:
   - `client/src/controllers/AssessmentFlowController.tsx`
   - `client/src/services/AssessmentService.ts`
   - Related test files

2. Key Implementation Goals:
   - Navigation logic system
   - State synchronization
   - Progress persistence
   - Error recovery

### Afternoon Session (Documentation)
1. Priority Documentation:
   - Component documentation
   - Testing strategy
   - API interfaces
   - Architecture decisions

2. Documentation Location:
   - `/docs/components/`
   - `/docs/testing/`
   - `/docs/api/`
   - `/docs/architecture/`

### Evening Session (Technical Debt)
1. Implementation Focus:
   - Retry mechanism
   - Logging system
   - Error recovery
   - Performance monitoring

2. Files to Update:
   - `client/src/utils/errorHandling.ts`
   - `client/src/utils/logging.ts`
   - `client/src/services/RetryService.ts`

## Success Metrics for Tomorrow 📊

### Technical Goals
- Flow Controller: 100% complete
- Documentation: 30% complete
- Technical Debt: 2 items addressed
- Test Coverage: Maintain >80%

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass
- No regression in coverage
- Documentation follows templates
- Code review completed

### Deliverables
- Completed Flow Controller
- Initial documentation set
- Enhanced error handling
- Updated test coverage report

## Notes for Tomorrow 📝
