# Sprint 1 - Day 1 Retrospective (2024-03-18)

## What Went Well
1. **Development Progress**
   - Completed 4 out of 6 story points
   - Delivered four major components:
     - QuestionPresentation
     - ProgressTracker
     - ScoreVisualization
     - ResultsPresentation
   - Successfully implemented tasks 5.1-5.24

2. **Quality Metrics**
   - 174 passing tests (100% pass rate)
   - Full accessibility compliance achieved
   - Responsive design implemented across all components
   - Test-driven development approach maintained

3. **Process Improvements**
   - Established component development workflow
   - Implemented comprehensive testing strategy
   - Exceeded expected velocity (0.6 points/day)

## What Could Be Improved
1. **Technical Challenges**
   - Need more granular task breakdown
   - Consider smaller, more focused commits
   - Review component coupling and dependencies

2. **Process Issues**
   - Initially missed retrospective documentation
   - Documentation updates not real-time
   - Need better progress tracking between updates

3. **Dependencies and Blockers**
   - No current blockers
   - Need clearer dependency documentation
   - Resource planning for remaining tasks

## Action Items
- [ ] Create retrospective template for daily use (Completed)
- [ ] Set up documentation checkpoints throughout the day
- [ ] Implement more granular task tracking
- [ ] Add commit message templates for consistency

## Learnings
1. **Technical Insights**
   - React component architecture patterns for assessment tools
   - Effective test organization for complex UI components
   - Accessibility implementation best practices

2. **Process Learnings**
   - Need for consistent documentation rhythm
   - Importance of real-time progress tracking
   - Value of detailed component planning

3. **Risk Management**
   - Identified: Documentation consistency
   - Mitigation: Created standardized templates
   - Contingency: Daily documentation checkpoints

## Next Steps
1. Continue with remaining UI wireframe tasks
2. Implement documentation improvements
3. Maintain current development velocity
4. Focus on granular progress tracking
