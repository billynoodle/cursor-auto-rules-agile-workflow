# Epic-1: Core Assessment Framework Development for Allied Health Practices
# Story-2: Enhance UI Components with Radix UI for Improved Accessibility and User Experience

## Story

**As a** healthcare practice administrator
**I want** an accessible and user-friendly assessment interface
**so that** I can complete the assessment efficiently regardless of my device or accessibility needs

## Status

Draft

## Context

Following the successful implementation of the core assessment questionnaire functionality in Story-1, we now need to enhance the user interface components to provide a better user experience and ensure accessibility compliance. The current implementation uses basic HTML elements with custom styling, which has limitations in terms of accessibility and mobile responsiveness.

### Background Information
- Current implementation uses basic HTML elements (radio buttons, inputs, textareas)
- Custom CSS is used for styling
- Basic accessibility attributes are in place
- All core functionality is working and tested

### Current State
- Assessment page is functional with working module navigation
- Questions can be answered and progress is tracked
- Module unlocking logic is implemented
- Tests are passing for all current components

### Technical Context
- React application using TypeScript
- Radix UI library is already installed but not utilized
- Current component structure:
  - QuestionnaireNavigation
  - QuestionModule
  - Question
  - Custom tooltips

### Business Drivers
- Need for better accessibility compliance
- Improved mobile user experience
- Consistent design language across components
- Future scalability for additional question types

### Relevant History
- Story-1 established the core assessment framework
- Current implementation focuses on functionality over advanced UI features
- Test coverage is comprehensive for existing components

## Estimation

Story Points: 5
(Equivalent to 5 days of human development or 50 minutes of AI development)

## Constraints

1. Technical Constraints
   - Must maintain existing functionality
   - Must pass all current tests after migration
   - Must support all current question types
   - Must maintain or improve current accessibility features

2. Business Constraints
   - Cannot disrupt user experience during migration
   - Must maintain or improve performance
   - Must support all modern browsers
   - Must work on mobile devices

3. Timeline Constraints
   - Should be completed before adding new assessment modules
   - Migration should be done component by component to minimize disruption
