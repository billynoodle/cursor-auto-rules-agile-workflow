# Epic-1: Core Assessment Framework Development for Allied Health Practices
# Story-2b: Enhance UI Components - Tasks 1-2 (Component Audit and Test Framework)

## Tasks

1. - [ ] Component and Test Audit
   1. - [ ] Document current component hierarchy and dependencies
   2. - [ ] Analyze current test coverage and patterns
   3. - [ ] Identify Radix UI components to replace current implementations:
      - Radio groups for multiple choice questions
      - Progress indicators for module progress
      - Tooltips for help text
      - Accordion for module expansion/collapse
   4. - [ ] Create component migration priority list
   5. - [ ] Document current accessibility features
   6. - [ ] Identify accessibility gaps
   7. - [ ] Create accessibility improvement checklist
   8. - [ ] Document current CSS architecture
   9. - [ ] Plan CSS migration strategy to support Radix UI
   10. - [ ] Create rollback plan for each component

2. - [ ] Test Framework Updates
   1. - [ ] Create test utilities for Radix UI components
   2. - [ ] Update test configuration for Radix UI
   3. - [ ] Create test helpers for common Radix UI patterns
   4. - [ ] Write example tests for each Radix UI component type:
      - Radio group tests
      - Progress indicator tests
      - Tooltip tests
      - Accordion tests
   5. - [ ] Update snapshot test configuration
   6. - [ ] Create accessibility test suite:
      - ARIA attribute tests
      - Keyboard navigation tests
      - Screen reader tests
      - Focus management tests
   7. - [ ] Create mobile interaction test patterns
   8. - [ ] Update test documentation
   9. - [ ] Create test migration guide
   10. - [ ] Set up parallel test running for old and new components

## Implementation Notes

### Task 1: Component and Test Audit
- Focus on maintaining existing functionality while improving UX
- Document all current keyboard shortcuts and interactions
- Map current HTML elements to equivalent Radix UI components
- Consider impact on current state management
- Plan for backward compatibility during migration

### Task 2: Test Framework Updates
- Ensure test utilities support both old and new components during migration
- Add specific tests for Radix UI's accessibility features
- Include touch interaction tests for mobile support
- Consider test performance with added complexity
- Plan for gradual test migration alongside component updates

## Next Steps
- Begin with Task 1.1: Document current component hierarchy
- Review test coverage reports
- Create detailed component mapping document
- Set up test utilities for first component migration
