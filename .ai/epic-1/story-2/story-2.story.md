## Alignment with Story-1

This story enhances UI components as they are developed in Story-1, following the research, design, and data model considerations from Story-1b, Story-1h, and Story-1i. Key integration points include:

1. Research-Driven Components (Story-1b)
   - Practice size scaling
   - Country-specific variants
   - RAG model integration
   - Score interpretation
   - Discipline-specific plugins

2. Data Model Integration (Story-1h)
   - Complex enum handling
   - Rich question schema support
   - Conditional display logic
   - Help system integration
   - Material finder UI

3. Module and Scoring (Story-1i)
   - Progress visualization
   - Time estimation
   - Benchmark displays
   - Score interpretation
   - Practice profile integration

Each component will be migrated to Radix UI as it is developed in Story-1, ensuring:
- Consistent design language
- Built-in accessibility
- Mobile responsiveness
- Performance optimization
- Type safety
