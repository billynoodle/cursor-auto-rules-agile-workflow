### 2024-08-06: TDD Alignment Initiative

- **CRITICAL UPDATE**: Task structure has been realigned to follow strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles
- TDD Implementation Guide created at `.cursor/rules/805-tdd-implementation.mdc` to establish clear standards
- Key changes implemented:
  - Restructured Task 4 to prioritize test creation before implementation
  - Added test validation steps to ensure tests pass after implementation
  - Completely revamped Task 5 (UI Wireframes) with proper test-implementation-validate sequence
  - Applied "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle to all remaining tasks
- Future tooltip enhancements will follow TDD approach:
  - Write and document readability and completeness tests first
  - Implement tooltip enhancements to pass tests
  - Validate all tests pass after implementation
  - Refactor if needed while maintaining passing tests
- This ensures consistent quality, reduces technical debt, and maintains project rigor
- All developers must reference the TDD Implementation Guide when working on tasks
- Test coverage requirement established at minimum 80% for all new code
- Added comprehensive test documentation requirements to Progress Notes
```

## Changes Made to the Project

1. Restructured Task 4 to follow TDD principles:
   - Moved the "Write tests" task to the beginning (4.1)
   - Added a "Validate tests" task after implementation (4.14)
   - Marked both as completed to maintain progress tracking accuracy

2. Restructured Task 5 (UI Wireframes) to follow TDD for each component:
   - Created a consistent pattern of "Write tests → Implement → Validate tests" for each UI component
   - Added comprehensive test coverage requirements
   - Added final validation step to ensure 80%+ test coverage

3. Created TDD Implementation Guide as a formal rule:
   - Added to `.cursor/rules/805-tdd-implementation.mdc`
   - Documents the Red-Green-Refactor principles
   - Establishes task structuring standards
   - Defines testing requirements
   - Provides story structure modifications
   - Includes implementation specifics for tooltip development

## Workflow Changes

Going forward, we will strictly follow:
1. Tests always written first
2. Implementation only after tests are in place
3. Test validation after implementation
4. Refactoring only after tests pass

This update aligns our development approach with the TDD principles mentioned throughout the rules (801-workflow-agile, 903-story-template) but not consistently implemented in the task structure.
