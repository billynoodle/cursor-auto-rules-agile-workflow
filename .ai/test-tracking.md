# Test Coverage Tracking

## Current Status (March 19, 2024)

### Overall Metrics
- Statement Coverage: 86.63%
- Branch Coverage: 77.65%
- Function Coverage: 88.4%
- Line Coverage: 87.11%

### Service Layer Coverage
#### Assessment Services
- `AnswerService.ts`: 88.88% branch coverage
  - Remaining: Line 39 (error handling)
- `AssessmentDataService.ts`: 78.57% branch coverage
  - Remaining: Lines 100, 104, 111 (error handling)
- `AssessmentError.ts`: 100% coverage
- `AssessmentValidation.ts`: 100% coverage
- `OfflineService.ts`: 100% branch coverage
  - Note: Lines 14-18 (initialization) uncovered but acceptable

#### Main Services
- `AssessmentService.ts`: 37.68% branch coverage
  - Critical: Needs significant test improvements
  - Many uncovered lines in error handling and edge cases

### Component Coverage
#### Assessment Components
- `ProgressTracker.tsx`: 66.66% branch coverage
- `Question.tsx`: 91.66% branch coverage
- `QuestionModule.tsx`: 83.33% branch coverage
- `QuestionPresentation.tsx`: 88.23% branch coverage
- `QuestionnaireNavigation.tsx`: 85.71% branch coverage
- `ResultsPresentation.tsx`: 54.54% branch coverage (priority)
- `ScoreVisualization.tsx`: 72.72% branch coverage

### Integration Tests
#### Controller Tests (Currently Failing)
1. `AssessmentFlowController.init.test.ts`
   - Issue: Missing mock data module
2. `AssessmentFlowController.progress.test.ts`
   - Issue: Missing mock data module
3. `AssessmentFlowController.error.test.ts`
   - Issue: Missing mock data module
4. `AssessmentFlowController.state.test.ts`
   - Issue: Missing mock data module
5. `AssessmentFlowController.navigation.test.ts`
   - Issues:
     - Missing mock data module
     - Type mismatch in AssessmentService

### Priority Items
1. Fix missing mock data files
2. Address TypeScript errors in controller tests
3. Improve branch coverage in:
   - ResultsPresentation.tsx
   - AssessmentDataService.ts
   - AnswerService.ts

### Recent Improvements
- Added comprehensive error handling tests for assessment services
- Fixed TypeScript errors in test files
- Improved offline mode test coverage
- Added validation failure test cases

### Next Steps
1. Create centralized mock data system
2. Fix integration test setup
3. Address controller test TypeScript errors
4. Add missing branch coverage tests
5. Review and improve component coverage
