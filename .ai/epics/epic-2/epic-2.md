# Epic-2: Server-Side Business Logic and Integration Layer

## Overview
Enhance and extend the existing server-side application to handle complex business logic, integrations, and advanced features that complement the client-side assessment framework.

## Current State
The server implementation already includes:
- Basic TypeScript/Express setup
- Core models for questions and modules
- Initial services for research and modules
- Basic folder structure and middleware

## Business Value
- Enhanced data processing capabilities
- Improved security through additional validation layer
- Scalable integration with external services
- Advanced reporting and analytics capabilities
- Better performance through optimized backend operations

## Technical Goals
1. Extend the assessment engine with advanced features
2. Implement complex business logic processing
3. Create integration points with external services
4. Set up advanced reporting and analytics
5. Implement security and rate limiting

## Stories

### Story 2a: Assessment Engine Implementation

- Add progress tracking logic
- Implement answer validation
- Add recommendation engine
- Status: In Progress

### Story 2b: Data Processing Services
- Create data aggregation service
- Implement statistical analysis
- Add benchmarking capabilities
- Create reporting service
- Implement data export functionality
- Status: Planned

### Story 2c: Integration Layer
- Set up Supabase client
- Implement data synchronization
- Add real-time updates
- Create webhook handlers
- Set up event processing
- Status: Planned

### Story 2d: Performance Optimization

- Set up audit logging
- Enhance error handling
- Add security headers
- Status: Planned

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture
- Node.js/Express.js backend (✅ Implemented)
- TypeScript for type safety (✅ Implemented)
- Prisma for database access (✅ Implemented)
- Jest for testing (✅ Implemented)
- Docker for containerization (Planned)

### Security
- JWT authentication (Planned)
- Rate limiting (Planned)
- Request validation (Partial)
- CORS configuration (✅ Implemented)
- Security headers (Planned)

### Performance
- Response time < 200ms
- Support 1000 concurrent users
- 99.9% uptime
- Efficient caching
- Load balancing ready

### Monitoring
- Error tracking
- Performance metrics
- Usage statistics
- Health checks
- Audit logs

## Dependencies
- Client-side assessment framework
- Supabase integration
- External APIs
- Monitoring services
- Analytics platform

## Risks
1. Integration complexity with existing Supabase setup
2. Performance impact on complex calculations
3. Security considerations for external integrations
4. Scaling challenges with real-time features
5. Data consistency across services

## Success Criteria
1. All API endpoints documented and tested
2. Performance benchmarks met
3. Security audit passed
4. Integration tests passing
5. Monitoring and logging in place
6. Documentation complete

## Timeline
- Story 2a: 2 weeks
- Story 2b: 2 weeks
- Story 2c: 1 week
- Story 2d: 1 week
- Story 2e: 1 week

Total: 7 weeks

## Notes
- Build on existing server structure
- Maintain TypeScript best practices
- Focus on scalability
- Consider future extensions
- Document all algorithms
