# EPIC-1: Core Assessment Framework Development for Allied Health Practices

## Overview
Develop the core assessment framework for the Allied Health Business Assessment Tool, with initial focus on physiotherapy practices. This epic covers the comprehensive business assessment questionnaire structure, weighted scoring system, and all supporting components needed to provide quantifiable metrics and actionable insights for practice improvement.

## Business Value
- Enable practitioners to identify key areas for improvement with data-driven insights
- Provide quantifiable metrics through weighted scoring system
- Support practice scaling from solo practitioners to multi-location practices
- Enable future SOP generation capabilities
- Facilitate benchmarking against industry standards
