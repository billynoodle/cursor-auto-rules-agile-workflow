## Dev Notes

- Focus on creating a flexible question and scoring framework that can be extended in future stories
- Design all components with extension points for future allied health disciplines
- Ensure the initial implementation delivers a complete solution for physiotherapy while maintaining extensibility
- Create a plugin architecture that allows new disciplines to be added with minimal changes to the core framework
- Implement physiotherapy as the first discipline plugin to validate the architecture
- Use dependency injection and strategy patterns to allow for discipline-specific behavior
- Create clear interfaces between core components and discipline-specific extensions
- Ensure the core assessment contains universal questions applicable to all allied health practices
- Design the physiotherapy implementation to serve as a template for future disciplines
- Develop a discipline registry that manages available disciplines and their capabilities
- Create adapter patterns to transform discipline-specific data into a common format for the core framework
- Design scoring system to be both sophisticated in analysis but simple to understand
- Consider how question responses will map to actionable recommendations with quantifiable improvement metrics
- Design with scalability in mind to support future AI analysis capabilities
- Prioritize user experience to keep practitioners engaged throughout the assessment
- Balance comprehensive assessment with simplicity - use progressive disclosure for complex topics
- Ensure scoring methodology is statistically sound and produces meaningful results
- Create a robust framework for practice size scaling that maintains assessment integrity
- Design country-specific components to be easily extensible for future country additions
- Develop custom variable system that integrates seamlessly with the core assessment
- Consider appropriate tracking periods for different metrics when designing the framework
- Include SOP relevance metadata in the question framework to support future SOP generation using RAG models
- Design the assessment to collect necessary information for generating comprehensive SOPs
- Ensure the question framework can identify gaps in current processes that would benefit from standardized SOPs
- Create a comprehensive score interpretation system that provides clear positioning and actionable guidance
- Design the material finder tagging system to effectively identify relevant resources for SOP creation
- We've implemented a comprehensive approach to question design, ensuring all core business areas are covered.
- The tooltip review process has significantly improved the clarity and accessibility of complex financial and compliance questions.
- Testing has revealed critical insights about business area interconnectedness:
  - "Patient", "revenue", and "cost" are the most universal keywords appearing across almost all business areas
  - Financial questions about patient lifetime value have shown the highest interconnectedness, bridging 5 different business areas
  - Operations questions, particularly those related to scheduling and workflow, show strong connections to multiple other business domains
  - Technology adoption has significant cascading effects on operational efficiency, showing a high impact score of 9/10
- These interconnectedness findings will inform our prioritization algorithm and recommendation engine.
- The current implementation focuses on physiotherapy, but the framework is designed to be extensible to other disciplines.
- We've achieved excellent test coverage for both the QuestionService and the InterconnectednessService.
