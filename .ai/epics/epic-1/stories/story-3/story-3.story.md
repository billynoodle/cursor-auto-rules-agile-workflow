# Epic-1: Core Assessment Framework Development for Allied Health Practices
# Story-3: AssessmentPage Component Integration and Service Refactoring

## Story

**As a** developer
**I want** to properly integrate all assessment components and refactor monolithic services
**so that** we have a maintainable, testable, and cohesive assessment interface with proper phase and state management

## Status

In Progress

## Context

During the sprint review on March 25, several issues were identified:
- 8 unused assessment components identified
- Missing phase management system
- Incomplete state management
- Component dependencies not properly set up
- Test coverage gaps in integration areas
- Monolithic AssessmentService (614 lines) needs refactoring
- AssessmentFlowController (460 lines) has too many responsibilities

This story is critical for completing Story-1 as it addresses the component integration blocker and ensures proper functionality of the assessment framework.

### Testing Approach
- Jest and React Testing Library for component tests
- Integration tests for service interactions
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Minimum 80% test coverage requirement
- Supabase mocking for offline/online scenarios

## Test Results

Current test coverage:
- Statements: 75.24%
- Branches: 38.88%
- Functions: 78.26%
- Lines: 74.48%

Target after implementation:
- All metrics above 80%
- Focus on branch coverage improvement
- Full integration test coverage

## Dev Notes

- Follow TDD approach for all new components
- Use React Context for state management
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add detailed logging for debugging
- Consider implementing feature flags for gradual rollout
- Ensure backward compatibility during refactoring
